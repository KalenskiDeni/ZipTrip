# OFF THE PATH 

Welcome to the glorious adventure of our AmAzInG coded webapp solution!

Get ready to amazed by our stupid choices, obvious help from ChatGPT, and "copy-paste" code lines from RACE's given templates ;D


## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Open the digital solution

...duh


### 2. Resize the page to mobile size üì≤

We reccommend 393px x 804px ;) or just open it on your phone


### 3. Explore, explore, EXPLORE!!!

But don't click on too many things, as some "sudden misstakes" can be accidentally found ü´¢ü§≠


### 4. See who did what... *eghem, eghem*

Look for names mentioned in the comments, or find something else... (hint: I can buy myself floweeeeers)


### 5. Okay, that's enough fun time

When you've had enough of our masterpiece, get "off our path" and pls be nice to us in the exam room‚ò∫Ô∏è
